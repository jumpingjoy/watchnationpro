A smartwatch can be considered as a Mini smartphone or a Minicomputer in this 21st century.

The apps installed on the smartphone help in providing and receiving the required data to the smarphhone. The user can enjoy music and can watch videos using wireless handsets too.

Standalone Smartwatches are exclusively designed to work independently without connecting to a smartphone. They have exclusive in-built sensors that can work with high accuracy. These are smartwatch devices designed with dedicated and accurate sensors mostly used in medical or healthcare, sports, and security forces.

For example, Fitness Band for Healthcare may not have features supported by smartwatches like calling functions, notifications, etc., and have apps and sensors that process the user's body activities. These come with their application that can track your heart rate, body temperature, etc.,

Few models support Sports activities, and these smartwatches track the wearer's walking & running rate using the App inbuilt in the smartwatches.

#### How smartwatch is different from standalone fitness bands?
