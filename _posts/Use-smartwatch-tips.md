## 1. Get the Ideal fit
You simply set it on and fasten it closely, right? Sort of. It is quite easy to strap any wearable and start using it. Nonetheless, it's essential to be mindful of how it matches. Are the buckles digging in? Is the substance irritating you a little? If it does not feel great today, you won't want to put on it later on.

You want a'just right' fit that is not so tight it leaves marks on your wrist but is tight enough for your detectors to work properly. For instance, most wearable devices nowadays have a heartbeat sensor built-in to the trunk. In order for this to measure blood flow correctly, it has to be close to your skin.

Play around with just how tight you wear your new smartwatch or fitness tracker and, should you need to and it's potential with your device, swap the strap out for a single that is a better match or produced from a comfortable cloth.

## 2. Make placing it on a good habit

Picking the best charging place for your own wearable device, so you don't forget about it, is part of a larger thought about turning your wearable and wearing it, checking it, and charging it in to behaviour that feels natural and habitual.

This is the reason why we advocate borrowing some suggestions from habit-building concept to assist. This doesn't have to be extensive or confusing. Rather, we can pick and choose what we  can incorporate.

Social scientist and researcher at Stanford University BJ Fogg is a big believer in the power of prompts. In his book, Tiny Habits, he clarifies that no behaviour occurs without a prompt. This is basically anything, which tells you to do a thing today. He offers the example of a woman who'd do exactly the identical morning , then writes her priorities onto a post.

Prompts could be physical, and like that instance, perhaps you could place a Post-it saying"Fitbit" next to your coffee maker or on your mirror? Or what's known as a circumstance prompt, this is when you're prompted to do something because you connect it with anything else -- in the case above, we had started to associate creating a java with strapping my tracker on.

Additional prompts that Fogg recommends are: sending yourself a text message, writing in your bathroom mirror, placing the alert with your voice helper, and adhering a reminder on your fridge. Every one these could work nicely in regards to encouraging yourself to place on your new tracker.

The good news is, this simple prompt for one simple behavior can have a beneficial impact on other behaviours. Fogg writes:"what had begun with one Post-it turned into a productivity avalanche."

## 3. Connect with other services and apps
Most wearables can do a good deal, but they can not tell you everything that there is to know about your wellbeing and physical fitness. For example, many can monitor your activity and heart rate levels. However few have menstrual tracking characteristics that are as good as programs like Clue and Glow. What's more, some have supplements, but not many are as extensive as MyFitnessPal. That means you may want to sync up the apps you use and love to your brand new wearable and its own app. Simply put, you'll want to receive your programs to speak to each other so it's possible to get more from every one of them and learn more about yourself.

The means to do that is different for each and every wearable, but most have a section in the configurations called'programs' or'connections.' There's normally a listing of supported programs here, and you may pick which one you'd love to give permission to get your health and physical fitness data.

That is also a great method of revoking access to programs you do not want to get your health and fitness data. On that point, look out for any apps hoping to look for permission to access data that they just don't need. Always question if an program wants to understand your step count or your location. When it's not obvious why -- a health program or taxi app, for instance -- then do not allow it.

## 4. Establish your aims
when you have a fitness tracker since there's something specific you want to do and it is going to help you, which almost all of the time there is, benefit from the tracker's goal-setting feature. This could be putting a measure goal for daily or if you're training for something and have a device assembled for Fitness, specific space, or period goals. If you would like to raise your own Fitness normally, you may want to specify a goal of just five days of exercise per week, regardless of what it is.

We love to utilize wearables even when we do not have a super-specific goal in mind, but there'll always be something we're considering hitting -- eight hours , 8,000 measures, something like that. The key for us over the years is to focus on one thing at one time. Our wearable tech can track a lot of things, but it can work better when we have got one clear goal at once.

This is also the basic assumption of Greg McKeown's book Essentialism. The idea is it to achieve more; we ought to pursue less material and do it better. There's a whole lot more to McKeown's essentialist view of life, but a few key items for us to recall in regards to fitness trackers is: choose what to pay attention to (don't feel like you have to do whatever ), eliminate obstacles to make your goals easier and experience pleasure in the journey of doing things.

This sounds great in concept, but what exactly does it look like in practice? To us, it is picking one goal to place and think about at one time, editing an app's house screen so that which we would like to focus on is that there and what we don't isn't. It's also about making the customizations to the program and wearable screen mentioned above -- we want to remove barriers. Finally, experiencing joy for us includes less pressure and more games, entertaining badges, and, importantly, ways to turn off when we need to -- that we will come to soon.
