Article Body:
Many public buildings now operate loop hearing systems to help people with hearing loss, and by using hearing aids, communicate more effectively.

If a building has a hearing loop they will normally display a sign showing the hearing loop symbol. This symbol is an ear with a line struck diagonally through it.

When purchasing a hearing aid always ensure it has hearing loop functionality, with an induction pick up, if you wish to use the hearing aid in buildings with a hearing loop. A “T” usually symbols that the hearing aid has this function.

A hearing loop consists of an amplifier which is linked to the source of the sound, such as a microphone used by the clerk in a post office or bank.

The amplifier sends the signal as an electric current through the loop, which is then picked up by the individual hearing aid.

The hearing loop allows the users hearing aid to work very effectively and substantial reduces background noise, to deliver a much improved sound quality.  The user can adjust the hearing aid as they would do normally to a suitable level of sound.

Using a hearing loop with a modern hearing aid is very simple and is designed to be as user friendly as possible.
When in a designated hearing loop area a user simply needs to turn the hearing aid to the ‘’T’’ setting, to pick up the signal from the loop.

When using a hearing loop the user is also able to make adjustments on their hearing aid, to optimise the quality of sound, based on their own individual requirements.

The use of a hearing loop makes the importance of a good hearing aid even greater. If good hearing in public buildings is important then ensure you purchase a hearing aid with the loop functionality.
