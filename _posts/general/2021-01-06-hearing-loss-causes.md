Diagnosis of Deafness and Hearing Loss

Many people have reported that it is often difficult to gain a specific diagnosis and causes for their hearing loss and deafness.

As with many medical conditions there are normally a high number of causes and individual circumstances to consider, even when using the most sophisticated diagnosis technology it is very difficult to give an accurate diagnosis.

It is widely considered that there are 2 main causes for hearing loss & deafness in patients.

Sensorineural Hearing loss

Sensorineural hearing loss is the most prevalent cause of deafness in the UK.

This diagnosis relates to damage to the nerves with in the ear and is often referred to as ‘nerve deafness’.
Inside the cochlea in the inner ear are hair cells which pass information on sound impulses via nerves to the brain. Any damage that impairs this transfer of this information from the hair cells of the inner ear to the auditory nerve and finally the brain will cause Sensorineural Hearing.
Example causes for Sensorineural Hearing Loss include;
Aging Process - As we get older we can loose of hair cells in the cochlea and this is often responsible for hearing loss for those over 6.
Acoustic Trauma - very loud noises can damage hair cells.
Infections - These can cause loss of hair cells i.e. mumps or meningitis

Conductive Hearing Loss

Conductive Hearing loss is basically caused by obstruction in the outer ear which prevents or inhibits sound passing to the inner ear.

This can be caused by anything that interferes with the transmission of sound from the outer to the inner ear, such as;
Ear infections
Glue ear
Build up of wax,
Damage to the ossicles or perforated eardrum

Hearing aids are an obvious choice to help with hearing loss. There are many types and style available to suit most users needs, and can help improve the user’s lifestyle.
