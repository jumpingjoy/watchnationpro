Hearing aids which fit in the ear.

When removing your hearing aid before you go to bed you should carefully wipe down with a soft dry cloth or tissue. You should also spend some time inspecting the part of the hearing aid that fits into the ear canal as it is likely that a accumulation of  ear wax may have occurred. If this is the case then you will have to remove the wax. When you purchased the hearing aids you should receive a cleaning tool which can be used to do this which usually takes the form of a wire pick or a brush or you could also use a toothbrush.

Hearing aids which fit behind the ear.

As with the above, the procedure is similar. However, the main difference being that the ear mould which fits into the ear which is usually made of Lucite or silicone which is non-electrical and therefore can be washed in mild soapy water. Before washing it is important to ensure the earpiece is disconnected from the behind the ear section to ensure the electrical part of the hearing aid does not get wet. Dry the ear piece correctly before using and also ensure that the tube is clear of water. Please note  that the tube may need to be replaced after a period of time usually 3 to 6 months as the flexibility may be lost.

Things not to do…

1. Wash the hearing aid with solvents or alcohol as this may cause the materials from which the aid is made to break down. You can purchase special cleaning fluids designed to clean hearing aids.

2. Don’t let the electrical part of the hearing aid get wet. Avoid wearing the aid when showering of bathing.

3. Try not to drop the hearing aid, especially on a hard floor as this may cause the hearing aid to break.
