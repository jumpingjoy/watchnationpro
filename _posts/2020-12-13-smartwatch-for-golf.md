### Garmin Approach S62

![Smartwatch-for-golf]({{site.baseurl}}/uploads/garmin-approach-s62.png)

From a perspective of a golfer, tech wearable options have generally fallen into two classes: golf-focused GPS watches, which are relatively useless off the course, or smartwatches with serviceable but hardly satisfying golf apps.

The new Approach s62 Garmin golf view tries to bridge the difference.  It places golf first but includes a host of activity and lifestyle features on the side.  That is an ambitious device that isn't just a golf course GPS but is also a shot tracker.

Garmin Approach S62: Golf GPS Highlights

After using two older productions of Garmin's Vivoactive (the Vivoactive 4 now retails for $349), I had been looking forward to using a Garmin device that put golf at the forefront.  The benefits are immediately evident with the screen and gap flyovers.  But also, the s62 does not need to be tethered to your phone to work on the program.  The device comes pre-loaded with 41,000 courses worldwide.  Leave your mobile and its distractions at the trunk.

The large 1.3-inch touchscreen display (and three large buttons on the ideal side) provides color hole overviews, also in addition to front-middle-back green spaces. You might even view distances to the front and rear of dangers like greens and bunkers, drag target zone yardages in order to determine layup distances or dogleg landing zones.

Much like online golf cart GPS units, you can drag a target on the lookout to get specific yardages to stains on a pit.

This feature is where it gets better: **Automatic shot monitoring**

My experience is the first time I've had shot-tracking abilities on the course, and I must admit that I'm hooked.  The watch uses detectors to detect if you hit a shot (you can hit multiple shots in precisely the same place and it will only graph one - and then chart another shot once you swing from a different place ).  You can see your shot history for the round along with your historical shots on this program.

There are a few instances when the device might miss detecting a shot.  You'll have to add it to the program after the round.  If you don't have the CT10 club detectors (compatible and available for an extra $299), then you will need to assign a bar to every shot after the round (and assign putts to get your GIR amounts ), so it'll take a couple of minutes.

The S62 shooter tracking function doesn't monitor chips and putts, and it does not know if you hit the green or never.  Invest in CT10 detectors to get the most essential for game analysis. If not, you may need to take a few minutes off after every round, if on your cell program or pc, and examine your fairways and include putts.

I also noticed that "fairways hit" in the shot tracker is not always accurate.  This makes sense as it will be impossible for GPS mapping to understand current mowing lines, particularly in the winter.  You may choose to adjust some of your shot places after the round if you want credit for all fairways hit.

**Virtual Caddie**: Garmin promotes a Virtual Caddie that can assist you with shot and club selection on the program if tethered to a smartphone.  I have a hard time putting faith in a human caddie, much less a virtual one.  

I had to sync this up and upgrade with my computer's Garmin Connect program.  It's been trouble-free since.

**Battery Life**: The S62 battery life is superb! ! Compared to Apple Watch 3 & 4, which must be recharged every day no matter how far I was using the GPS.  The  S62 can go about 14 days with no charge or roughly 20 hours of GPS time.  

**Action Widgets**: All of the action widgets you're used to with Garmin are all here.  Record swims (it's waterproof), bike rides, runs, stationary materials, strength, paddleboarding, and a whole lot more.

**Fitness trackers**: The Approach S62 includes a heart-rate track and pedometer which tells me how many steps I took during a round of golf).  It also has a few new wellness measuring features such as "Body Battery" , strain, and Pulse OX dimensions.

For the golfer who is active in many other sports and indifferent to another lifestyle third-party wearable apps, this is the device.

**Apps:** My Garmin vs. The Grint golf app dilemma

All that said, I am torn on what program to use as my golf game tracking's"source of fact."  Garmin, along with The Grint, both pose very compelling cases.  The Grint does not have its hardware; however, it has what is, in my view, the best Apple Watch Golf Program, and also provides premium members using an Official World Handicap.  It also has a stronger social and community element.

Garmin shines with a golf program that's a whole lot more intuitive rather than bounced off the display for additional non-golf-watch alerts.  The auto shot tracker is also great (you can monitor shots manually with your smart mobile on The Grint).  One recent development is Garmin's program recently took off two attributes I loved: Dream Round and typical hole scores in Course Stats.  Reps from Garmin say they were not popular but may add it back at some point later.  I hope they do.

**Final Verdict**: I've used a couple of smartwatches in the past couple of decades, including Apple Watch, which has various third-party golf and scoring programs (full review of the device and programs here).    I'm an Apple fanboy for Mac and iPhone; however, I can confidently say that I favor Garmin on my wrist every day.  

## Garmin Approach S60
Garmin has become a fixture at the golfing GPS marketplace recently.  Lately, I got an opportunity to try out the Garmin S60 GPS watch. Long story short, I was somewhat blown by the assortment of attributes that this product has off and on the golf program.  

It carries a high price tag, but after rigorously testing the watch a number for the additional offerings in the market at this time, I feel that is best in class.  I shall go through each one of the main attributes in this article and attempt to provide you a comprehensive comprehension of whether this is the correct watch for your sport.  

### Performance on the Golf Course: Highlights
I have Played over 20 rounds in this stage with all the Garmin S60.  I will confidently tell you that it provides a beautiful mixture of performance throughout your round, which no other GPS watch has right now.  

There is a slew of features to get through, but I will discuss what I think are the core advantages and identifying variables.  

As you would anticipate, the watch readily heaps the advice of your golf course within a few minutes.  Garmin includes a library of 41,000 classes.  I discovered that the yardages to be exceptionally accurate (I contrasted them to my rangefinder and class yardage markers ).  It reveals front, center, and back yardages into the green. The screen is quite clear, and there aren't any problems seeing it in solid sunlight.  I discovered that I could readily play with two rounds of golf on a single charge
(approximately 8-10 hours of battery life).  

Those are fundamental features That Won't place it apart from several other golfing GPS watches on the market for a far lower cost.  

The main benefit of this opinion, in my view, is that the Mapping attribute.  Here is the only watch in the marketplace where you can zoom into various points of a pit and assess your precise yardages to clean bunkers, water hazards, and other significant places.  Generally, you would have to buy a lot bigger GPS unit to find this operation.  It's on your wrist using a Garmin S60.  This is a massive feature and will surely make you a much better course supervisor.  

### Other Useful Features
It automatically feels when you hit a shot and will show how much it was struck at the peak of the display.  This helps determine your actual yardages with nightclubs, brag on your best drives, and really will be able to aid you in finding errant balls off the tee.  If you decide to maintain your score, the Garmin S60 automatically senses when you're on the green and also prompts you to input your strokes to the hole.  

Permits you to alter pin spots onto the green to find more precise yardage factors in uphill and downhill yardage to get a"plays like" amount (could be disabled for tournament play).  
Simplifies your measures to your round and total miles walked.

The assortment of attributes on the training course is relatively robust.
There was another performance into this Garmin Approach S60, which I discovered to be crucial.  Here is the only opinion that may measure your swing rate.  

The Perfect swing rate for most golfers was discovered to be 3.0.  This implies that your backswing will be just (or close to) twice provided your downswing.  In years past, the only way to measure your swing rate was through camera eyeglasses or swing analyzers.  

The Garmin S60 Permits You to measure your swing speed. During training sessions, and that's the way I've been using it together with Tour Tempo defeats.  You may observe the time elapsed on either your backswing, downswing, and be sure you're locating a repeatable ratio.  

The Garmin S60 goes one step farther -- it automatically tracks the speed of your swings on your rounds.  Personally, this is a real eye-opener for me. I discovered that through my rounds, my pace increases radically.  My backswing is usually way too slow in my errant shots.  In other words, this is a fantastic attribute and, for me personally, was a massive benefit.  

### Non-Golf Capabilities
The Garmin Approach S60 performs quite admirably as a smartwatch and physical fitness tracker.  The watch is beautiful looking on your wrist and may fit in the rest of your life if you're trying to find that functionality.  These may not be significant for a number of you; however, it's well worth mentioning.  

I've been using it as a fitness tracker.  While it does not function entirely and a Fitbit, several features are well worth noting for you exercise enthusiasts.  

The smartwatch senses your movements during the day and buzzes in your wrist to remind you to get up and proceed if it senses inactivity for a long time. Furthermore, it is going to keep track of your workouts and steps.  While it does not automatically monitor your pulse, I bought a Garmin core band to utilize during my twist workouts.  You obtain an accurate reading of your heartbeat and just how successful your workouts will be.  

Everything is synced very well with the Garmin smartphone program.  You get a birdseye view
of your action for the month or week.  

You could set the watch with your smartphone via Bluetooth.  It'll show you incoming calls, emails, and text messages using buzzing notifications on your wrist.  While it's not as slick as the Apple Watch, the basic functionality is not there.  

### Final Word!!
Is Your Garmin Approach S60 Worth The Cost?  

That is by far and away from the best golfing GPS watch on the market at the moment.  I can tell you that with no doubt.  However, the cost is pretty steep.  For people who want basic yardages to the front, middle, and rear of greens without breaking the bank, it likely makes sense to obtain a unit such as a GolfBuddy Voice two.  

Garmin Approach S60 is a premium product that packs all sorts of features.  If you're on the market for a smartwatch, gym, and fantastic golfing GPS, then it's possible to find all those rolled into one.  Garmin did a superb job with this item, and if you use it for a little while, it is possible to see why.
