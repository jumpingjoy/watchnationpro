Samsung's smartwatch also includes excellent health and security features, such as fall detection, the same as the Apple Watch. It can monitor stress levels and heart rate, also, and inform you once you want to unwind.

<table class="uk-table uk-table-striped">
    <thead>
        <tr>
            <th>Feature</th>
            <th>Benefit</th>

				</tr>
				<tr>

				</tr>
    </tbody>
</table>

![fitbit]({{site.baseurl}}/uploads/fitbit.png)

Speaking of easyness, Fitbit has been viewed among the very most user-friendly in regards to smartwatches. Fitbit is just one of those big titles in fitness-focused watches.   

<table class="uk-table uk-table-striped">
    <thead>
        <tr>
            <th>Feature</th>
            <th>Benefit</th>

### More Smartwatches for Elderly that are worth a look

#### Lively Call (üèÉ Runner Up 1)

Contrary to the Apple Watch or Samsung Galaxy Watch, the Lively includes its 24/7 emergency support you may use for assistance at any moment.

<table class="uk-table uk-table-striped">
    <thead>
        <tr>
            <th>Feature</th>
            <th>Benefit</th>

#### Freedom Guardian (üèÉ Runner Up 2)

The working of Freedom Guardian Watch is very similar to the Lively.  

<table class="uk-table uk-table-striped">
    <thead>
        <tr>
            <th>Feature</th>
            <th>Benefit</th>
        </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
        <tr>
            <td>Designed specially for the old age people</td>
						<td>Ease of use for elderly people</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
            <td>24/7 support for fall or emergency situations</td>
						<td>Instant support if user falls on ground</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
            <td>Big screen suitable for older people</td>

						<td>Easy and quicker communication</td>
				</tr>

Freedom Guardian works similarly to a walkie-talkie, and you're able to connect 24/7 to emergency services or receive non-emergency assistance. The easy-to-use screen is another plus.   Plus, it has all of the features you wish to stay safe, including sudden fall notifications, GPS monitoring, and medication reminders. Nonetheless, it's cheap, and the monthly cost comes in at $20.

It's essential to be aware that the Freedom watch is only compatible with AT&T support, which means if you have any other cellular supplier, you will have to receive another plan.
Additionally, it lacks several advanced features like heart rate monitoring and stress level testing.
