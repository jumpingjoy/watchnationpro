# Smartwatches for Women

## Problems Faced By Women in day-to-day life
Jenny is a working woman who travels by local transport. Whenever she is traveling, answering important office calls through mobile is difficult for her. Jenny finds it difficult to reach out to her smartphone because of the crowd around her bus.

Holding a grip on bags and a mobile phone is very tough for her while traveling amid congestion in the local both in the morning and evening rush hours. Even if jenny uses a headset, she has to maintain the wire length between her ear and smartphone. While using a headset, one cannot initiate calls through the headset.

We all have women like Jenny at our home who faces the following kinds of problems:

### Do you find it difficult to track menstrual cycle?
You can be missing your reminder on your menstrual cycle's dates. Most of the women suffers from stress during their menstrual time, which may result in decreased work productivity during office hours. If you could remember the dates or have a gadget like smartwatch that can remind you, you can pre-plan your leaves and rest at home.

## Does your busy schedule make you miss your exercise?
You may find no time to exercise her health. On the weekend also, she has to plan other shopping for household things and caring for children. She wishes to take a walk in the late evening. But she is not able to find whether the distance she walked is enough to burn the calories. Because of their office job, she got obese. She needs some exercises. While doing exercises, she needs to know how long she has walked.

## Do you  miss out on purchase reminders
Jenny plans to purchase things she requires while coming back from the office for dinner; she puts reminders in her smartphone for everything, like purchasing a list of groceries, vegetables, fruits, and other things.  But she misses most of the reminders and notifications as the phone is not with her all the time.

## Does your Watch look odd with your clothing outfits?
It is necessary to wear watches that looks good with women's outfits. Some watches do not have the option to change the strap according to the outfits or it is difficult to change it as and when required.

> Finally, Jenny's friend Mary suggested to use smartwatches to solve all the problems faced by women.

## Quick Checklist before Buying a Smartwatch for Women:

**Fit to Wrist:** Ensure that the display fits the small wrist of women. If not, it will look unfit and uncomfortable.

**Option to change watch strap:** Ladies are always obsess with designs and colors that suit their outfits.Look whether the smartwatch you choose have the option to change the strap easily.

### Fitbit Sense

Price when reviewed: $329

Fitbit's sense is apt for health-conscious people. It backs all the sensors that are not available in other watches near as same as Versa.

The bands have two kinds of stainless steel with AMOLED displays having 40mm size. Health features like heart rate, sleep tracker, women's health trackers, and menstrual cycle monitors are provided in Fitbit.

Advanced health trackers come with Fitbit sense. ECG sensor for a minute heart activity tracker, optical heart rate sensor to track pulses, Stress monitoring app EDA are the highlights in Fitbit. As its name says, it senses everything that a health-conscious person looks for.

Excellent battery life is the most significant advantage of sense. It provides six days of battery life. Charging also takes significantly less time, approximately 12 minutes only. Like Versa, it has Fitbit Pay.

GPS tracks your miles and location on your runs and travels. Waterproof features allow you to swim.

### Samsung Galaxy Watch Active 2

Top brand Samsung Galaxy has released another version Active 2. It doesn't meet all the standards of the Samsung galaxy, scores equally with Samsung Galaxy in its style.

You can aspire to all the features that are available in Tizen. It comes in two sizes, 40mm and 44mm, can choose the one that fits your wrist. It has an AMOLED display.

In case you are an Android user and are not comfortable with Wear OS, Samsung galaxy active 2 is the best choice for you. Even though it does not have a rotating bezel, it comes with good touch sensitivity. The battery life has been developed from the first version of active.

Along with activities trackers, heart rate monitors, ECG monitors to track heart functionalities, and fall detection is available in Active 2.

### Michael Kors Access Sofie Heart Rate

This updated model has a light bezel and 41 mm casing size. It comes with a wide range of finishes, is almost like regular watches for daily usage.

It has NFC for Google pay and waterproof for swimming activity. It is suitable for gym-goers and fashionistas due to its design. Like other watches, activity trackers and health monitors are highlights of this model.

The wider watch face gives good looks and fits the small wrists too. Even though it covers the wrists, the design compensates for the looks.

### Skagen Falster 3

As its name indicates, it is the third release of Skagen in its smartwatch series. It runs on Wear OS. This stylish and eye-catching look attracts women by its charismatic look and other features.

The watch face has 11mm thick and is open for customization. The watch case is round and made of stainless steel. The straps are available in materials. You can go with your choice either for leather or for a metallic mesh, and it is average and straightforward in design. If you like simplicity more, you can go for it.

It provides alerts and notifications. It comes with controls for music and features that facilitate Google pay. Inbuilt GPS, 3ATM waterproof for swim purpose, and heart rate monitors are other things to mention. But it doesn't have LTE on-board, so even though GPS is available, you have to keep your smartphone nearby.

### Kate Spade Sport Smartwatch

Price when reviewed: $250

It was more likely for fitness in its previous version. This new one makes it more useful for sportspeople also. It suits work-outs and gym-goers while comparing with a typical fitness band. The unique design gets more attention.

The casing is 41mm in size and is made of light nylon and aluminum. The straps come either in leather or silicone material. These silicone straps are sweat-friendly. So gym goers, people who work-outs more, and people who do more physical and heavy work can go for it.

Three designs are available. One is a pink strap with a bronze finish. The second one has a green strap and bronzed finish. The final one is full of black. That is the strap, and the finish is black with light purple.

You can set alerts and notifications. It facilitates Google pay through NFC and provides Google assistant, tracks activities, monitors heart rate and sleep, etc. It runs on Wear OS.

### Michael Kors Access MKGO

Price when reviewed $295

Compared with Kate Spade Sport Smartwatch above, the Access MKGO has more features and fitness-oriented than Michael Kors. It scores much due to people's mindset on smartwatches that are focused on activity trackers mainly.

As it has a 43mm casing size, we can claim it as unisex watches. But its looks and design suits both men and women. Even the wrist is small, the watch face fits the wrist and doesn't look more expansive than the wrist. It has an AMOLED display of 1.19 inches. It runs on the latest Wear OS.

The latest Wear OS and necessary hardware like inbuilt GPS and waterproof design are the highlights in this model. It is perfect for sports with swim-friendliness and a heart rate monitor.

Though many sports watches are available in the market, it stands alone due to its looks and design. In case you are searching for a sports watch with more fitness and activity trackers, but you are concerned about looks and design, you can choose this one.

## Fossil Sport
Price: $99.99

If you want sports at a low price, your best choice should be Fossil Sport under £100.

The casing comes in two different sizes, 41mm and 43mm. The silicone stay is sweat-friendly. The 41mm face looks good in small wrists. The straps are available in many colors.

It runs on Wear OS and provides notifications and alerts like email and app information. NFC for Google pay is available.

Untethered GPS is convenient for runners who wish to keep their phones at home. The activity tracker, swim-proof, heart rate monitor is worth mentioning of Fossil Sport. The heart rate monitor is not up to standard.

It's also a solid smartwatch with everything you'd expect from a wearable running Wear OS, including NFC for Google Pay, email, notifications, and app alerts.

## Michael Kors Access Runway
Price when reviewed: $295

This stylish and good-looking watch gets attention in every woman's eyes. Its eye-catching design makes it look like jewelry rather than a watch. It is Michael Kors' third Wear OS model.

It has an AMOLED display of 1.19 inches. The display has 390 * 390-pixel resolution. The straps are available both in stainless steel and leather. It also comes with a ceramic model.

Activity trackers like run rate, step counts, and health features like heart rate, waterproof for swimming, and GPS are the highlights of Michael Kors' watch. But I can't fulfill all the trackers and features of Fitbit's Versa.

## Kate Spade Scallop 2

Price when reviewed: From $295

Version two of Kate spade runs on Wear OS like the first version of Kate spade scallop. It has the same attractive looks and covers almost the features of Fossil watches.

'Choose your look's app helps you pick the right watch face that matches your clothes and accessories. NFC for Google pay is a notable one. It has a button to control music and all. As it is waterproof, you can swim with that. It comes with the latest Wear OS. It has an AMOLED display. As the ambient light sensor adjusts the brightness, it can maintain the battery life decently.

## Bellabeat Time
Price when reviewed: $179

This good-looking watch is available in silver or rose gold colors with an average design. Apart from time display, health features are provided like sleep tracker, activities tracker, and fitness-oriented aspects. It uses vibration to send alerts and vibrations. The battery life lasts for six months, which is a highlight of this watch.

However, it doesn't cover other features of a smartwatch. So you can go for it, only if you want a regular watch with a few additional features.

## Fossil Q Neely

Price when reviewed: From $155

Fossil Q Neely is tiny with 36mm, but 12 mm thick in the casing gives good looks and comfort to wear. This hybrid watch is available at $155. Like every hybrid watch, it has the face of a regular watch.

All the activities are tracked through the Fossil Q app. Informations & notifications are expressed through vibration.

Controls are taken through three buttons on the edge of the right side of the watch. These buttons can be used to take selfies, control music's volume, playlist etc. The strap is made of leather with 16mm size.

## Garmin Vivomove 3

Price when reviewed: $219.99

It is one of the average options for women. This good-looking hybrid watch is ideal for daily wear. And Garmin's other running watch is the best for sportspeople for their regular training.

It comes with a 43mm size and 11.6mm casing, which is considerably better than other watches. The Main case is available in rose gold, silver, and black colors. The straps are made of leather or silicone with multiple shades.

Usually, hybrid watches have a button system. But Garmin provides a touchscreen in its hybrid watch. It seems something new and convenient to swipe and see data, activity trackers' outputs & messages.

Still, you are not convinced with these features; you can opt for Garmin's Vivomove Luxe, which gives more features, and at the same time, you have to pay more than Vivomove 3.

Heart rate monitor, stress monitor, and relaxation time indication are some of the features available in Vivomove 3. Fitness, sleep tracking, run rate, calorie count are a few of them. If you are fond of classic looks with smart information, it is the best choice for you.

## Withings Move

Price: $99.99

As we explained earlier, it is one of the hybrid watches. But its size is 38mm. It is small in size, but it is customizable on look. It is a basic watch.

You can change the strap's color and pattern, casing, and detailing with different colors and funny themes. But it has no OLED screen. It is not bright at all, has a regular and classic watch face.

It tracks activities such as swimming, walking, and running. But it has to be initiated by pressing the button that serves the hand of the watch because activity tracking is not automatic.

Withing is famous for its sleep monitoring, which tracks both lights, and sound sleep very accurately. Metrics are given with duration and quality as well.

As it doesn't have a power-consuming display, the battery life lasts for 18 months. As it lacks many other features, you can go for it if you are looking for a simple wristwatch with few smartwatch features only.
