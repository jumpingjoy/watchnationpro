You can be missing your reminder on your menstrual cycle’s dates. Stress management is difficult  during the menstrual time, resulting in decreased work productivity during office hours. If menstrual hygiene is not properly maintained may lead to medical complications such as uterine fibroids, endometriosis, PMDD, menorrhagia, etc. If a gadget like a girls smartwatch can assist you, you can pre-plan your leaves and rest at home to maintain your hygiene.

If you wear your watch too tight, you may have the following problems:

- Limits your wrist’s ability to move freely.
- Restrict blood flow in your arms and get marks on your wrists.
- Wearing a watch tight increases the stress on the bracelet and the risk of breaking is high

You may go to a party, and feel embarrassed when someone notices your watch look odd to your wrist size or outfits. Some do not have the option to change the watch band options or strap according to the outfits.

Do you face any other difficulty as a man, woman, kid, or elderly person that can be solved through a smartwatch?
