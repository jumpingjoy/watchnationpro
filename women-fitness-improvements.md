### Case Study: Heather Hendershot, 27, Pomona, Kansas
At 26, Heather Hendershot didn't think she had to worry about her health. She was young, athletic and had no previous medical conditions.

After putting her kids to bed one night, she was sitting on the couch with her husband when she heard a beep on her Apple Watch. She looked down to see a notification saying her heart rate was above 120 beats per minute.

"I thought the watch had to be wrong because I couldn't feel my heart racing," she says. "I didn't feel like anything was wrong at all."

In 2017, the Apple Watch added the high heart rate notifications to the watch, which let users know when their heart spiked above a certain level. Though Hendershot's heart rate continued to rise throughout the night, she still didn't feel any symptoms. The next morning her husband insisted that she make a precautionary visit to the urgent care clinic.

While there, they conducted strep throat and flu tests. Both came back negative, but her heart rate was so high that they decided to monitor her further.

"It wasn't until I heard the doctors mention ICU that I realized how serious the whole situation was," she says.

Doctors diagnosed her with hyperthyroidism, a condition where the thyroid gland produces excess thyroxine hormone. If left untreated, it could lead to life-threatening complications.

"I am not someone who checks their heart rate randomly," Hendershot says. "So I'm very confident that I wouldn't have been able to detect it without the Apple Watch."

## What Precautions Women Must Take When using smartwatch for fitness?

### 1. Get the fit right
You just put it on and fasten it tightly, right? Sort of. It’s very easy to strap any wearable on and start using it. But it’s important to be mindful about how it fits. Are the buckles digging in? Is the material irritating you a little? If it doesn’t feel good now, you won’t want to wear it in future.

You want a ‘just right’ fit that isn’t so tight it leaves marks on your wrist, but is tight enough for the sensors to work properly. For example, most wearable devices these days have a heart rate sensor built-in to the back. For this to measure bloodflow accurately, it needs to be close to your skin.

Play around with how tight you wear your new smartwatch or fitness tracker and, if you need to and it’s possible with your device, swap out the strap for one that’s a better fit or made from a more comfortable material.

### 2. Make putting it on a good habit

Picking the best charging place for your wearable device so you don’t forget about it is part of a wider consideration about turning your wearable and wearing it, checking it and charging it into behavior that feels natural and habitual.

This is why we recommend borrowing some suggestions from habit-building theory to help. This doesn’t have to be confusing or extensive. Instead, we can pick and choose what we incorporate.

Social scientist and researcher at Stanford University BJ Fogg is a big believer in the power of prompts. In his book, Tiny Habits, he explains that no behavior happens without a prompt. This is essentially something, anything, that tells you to do a thing now. He gives the example of a woman who would do the same morning routine, then write her priorities on a post-it note.

Prompts can be physical, like that example, maybe you could put a Post-it saying “Fitbit” next to your coffee machine or on your mirror? Or what’s known as a context prompt, this is when you’re prompted to do something because you associate it with something else – in the example above, we had begun to associate making a coffee with strapping my tracker on.

Other prompts that Fogg recommends are: sending yourself a text message, writing on your bathroom mirror, setting an alarm with your voice assistant and sticking a reminder on your fridge. All of these could work well when it comes to prompting yourself to put on your new tracker.

The good news is, this simple prompt for one simple behavior can have a positive effect on other behaviors. Fogg writes: “what had started with one Post-it turned into a productivity avalanche.”

### 3. Connect with other apps and services
Most wearables can do a lot, but they can’t tell you everything there is to know about your health and fitness. For example, many can track your activity and heart rate levels. But few have menstrual tracking features that are as good as apps like Clue and Glow. What’s more, some have nutritional tracking databases, but not many are as extensive as MyFitnessPal. That means you might want to sync up the apps you already use and love with your new wearable and its app. Simply put, you’ll want to get your apps to talk to each other so you can get more from each of them – and find out more about yourself.

The way to do this is different for every wearable, but most have a section in the settings called ‘apps’ or ‘connections’. There’s usually a list of supported apps here and you can select which one you’d like to give permission to access your health and fitness data.

This is also a good way of revoking access to apps you don’t want to access your health and fitness data. On that point, watch out for any apps trying to seek permission to access data that they just don’t need. Always question whether an app really needs to know your step count or your location. If it's not obvious why – a health app or taxi app, for example – then don't allow it.

### 4. Set your goals
If you have a fitness tracker because there’s something specific you want to do and it'll help you, which most of the time there is, take advantage of the tracker’s goal-setting feature. This could be setting a step goal for the day or, if you’re training for something and have a device built for fitness, particular distance or time goals. If you want to increase your fitness generally, you might want to set a goal of just five days of exercise a week, regardless of what it is.

We like to use wearables even when we don’t have a super specific goal in mind, but there’ll always be something we're interested in hitting – eight hours sleep, 8,000 steps, something like that. The key for us over the years has been to focus on one thing at a time. Our wearable tech can track a lot of things, but it can perform better when we’ve got one clear goal at once.

This is also the basic premise of Greg McKeown’s book Essentialism. The idea is that, to achieve more, we should pursue less stuff and do it better. There’s a lot more to McKeown’s essentialist view of life, but a few key things for us to remember when it comes to fitness trackers is: choose what to pay attention to (don’t feel like you have to do everything), remove obstacles to make your goals easier and experience joy in the journey of getting things done.

This sounds good in theory, but what does it look like in practice? To us, it’s choosing one goal to set and think about at a time, editing an app’s home screen so what ww want to focus on is there and what we don’t isn’t. It’s also about making the customizations to the app and wearable screen mentioned above – we want to remove obstacles. Finally, experiencing joy for us comes with less pressure and more games, fun badges and, importantly, ways to switch off when we need to – which we'll come to soon.

### 5. Ask yourself: what's your why?
When we spoke to Dr Carolyn Plateau she told us people are less likely to have problematic relationships with devices when they're used to improve general wellbeing and to read a positive goal rather than one that feels more negative, i.e. losing weight. If you feel like you need to lose weight and have support and a healthy mindset, we’re not stopping you. But this is about doing what’s right for you, choosing things that'll work in the long-run and not triggering bigger problems. So it’s worth considering your why from the get-go.

With all the focus here on goal-setting and habit-building, it’s also worth mentioning that fitness trackers can be used for awareness-building to begin with. What I mean is, maybe you don’t know what your step or sleep goal should be because, where would you begin?

Our advice would be to use the tracker for a month to see where you’re at now, what’s possible and what you might want to achieve in the future. So much is said for constantly improving and upgrading, maybe you just want to watch, track or just for things to stay how they are and to aim for more balance instead. There’s no right or wrong way to use health and fitness tech.
