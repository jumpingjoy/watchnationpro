### Case Study: Heather Hendershot, 27, Pomona, Kansas
In 26, Heather Hendershot didn't think she had to worry about her wellbeing. She was youthful, athletic, and had no previous medical problems.

After placing her children to bed one night, she had been relaxing and spending time with her husband when she heard an alert on her Apple Watch. She looked down to find a notification saying her heart rate was over 120 beats per second.

"I believed the watch needed to be wrong because I could not feel my heart racing," she says. "I did not feel like anything was wrong in any way."

In 2017, the Apple Watch additional elevated heart rate notifications to the view, which let users know if their heart spiked above a certain level. Though Hendershot's heart rate continued to climb throughout the night, she didn't feel any signs. The following morning her husband insisted that she create a precautionary trip to a nearby care clinic.

At the care clinic, they conducted strep throat and flu tests. Both resulted back negative, but her heart rate was so large that they chose to track her farther.

"It wasn't until I heard that the doctors mention ICU that I realized how serious the whole situation was," she says.

Physicians diagnosed her with hyperthyroidism, a condition in which the thyroid gland produces excess thyroxine hormone. If left untreated, it might result in life-threatening complications.

"I'm not someone who checks their heart rate randomly," Hendershot says. "So I'm very confident that I would not have been able to discover it with no Apple Watch."
