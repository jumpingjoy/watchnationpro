Before we jump into the technical details, let us have a brief look at the different types of smartwatches:

## What are the Smartwatches Types available?

There are two kinds of smartwatches available in the market:

* Smartwatches connected with smartphones
* Standalone smartwatches

### Smartwatches Connected with Smartphones
Smartwatches that are connected with smartphones through Bluetooth serve as an interface to the smartphones. Users can operate to attend phone calls or attend using the touchscreen or button present on the smartwatches. And also, it enables users to access messages, emails, media. The user can enjoy music and can watch videos using wireless handsets also. So these kinds of smartwatches are dependent on smartphones except for displaying the time.

### Standalone Smartwatches
Standalone Smartwatches are exclusively designed with sensors only. These are wearable devices designed with dedicated and accurate sensors mostly used in medical or healthcare, sports, and security forces.

For example, Fitness Band for Healthcare may not have features that are supported by smartwatches like calling functions, notifications, etc., and have apps and sensors that process body activities of the user. These come with their own application that can track your heart rate, body temperature, etc.,

Few models support Sports activities, and these smartwatches track the wearer's walking & running rate using the App inbuilt in the smartwatches.

### How smartwatch is different from standalone fitness bands?
Smartwatches have all the sensors of fitness bands. The only difference between the smartwatch and the standalone watches is that smartwatches can be connected with smartphones and operated, whereas standalone watches can be operated independently.

## Smartwatch Buying Guide: Quick Tips to Know

### Check Smartwatch Compatibility with Mobile OS

The Operating system in smartwatches must suit your smartphone's OS also. Otherwise, you have to face some lack of functions.

The Wear OS may not be attractive in its design, but its functionalities are highly recommendable.
Its speech-to-text features are very convenient to answer emails and texts with more comfortability. But the speech-to-text features of the wear OS won't work on the iPhone. That's why we insist you check the compatibility of your smartphone OS with the smartwatch OS.

> You can have a look below at how leading brands are performing in terms of compatibility.

#### Apple Compatibility
In the case of Apple, the Apple Watch works only with iPhone. Open the Apple Watch app on the iPhone and find the watch OS app store. It is here you can install your favorite iOS watch version apps or find the latest ones. The app store features mini things like games, fitness tracking apps productivity apps like receive slack notifications or review Trello cards.
The bottom line is that you must not buy a smartphone until you know that it is compatible with your smartphone.
