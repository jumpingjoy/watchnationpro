#### How is the hardware performance of the Samsung Galaxy Watch 3?

Our rating: ★★★★★ | 😎

Samsung uses in-house hardware for its watches. The dual-core Exynos 9110 SoC processor of Samsung watch 3 is more powerful and runs smoothly. 1 GB RAM is good enough for the fastest processing. It has usable 4.3GB storage out of overall 8GB storage.  Bluetooth 5.0, NFC A are available. In-built GPS with GLONASS and Beidou 7 is very accurate. Wi-Fi b/g/n and LTE (in selected variants) are available.

Our rating: ★★★☆☆ | 😐

It is compatible with both Android phones as well as iPhones. But its performance is much better with Samsung phones than other phones.

#### How is the battery life of Samsung Galaxy Watch 3 work?

Our rating: ★★★★★ | 😎

**Always-on display enabled:** Close to one on one Charge,
Always-ON display disabled: around two days or 56 hours.

**When using the only LTE:** Charge lasts for a day when using LTE.

But both the 247mAh and 340mAh  battery variants take more time to charge. The wireless magnetic charger takes two hours to get fully charged, which is a bit drawback compared to other competitors.  Samsung has to work on its charger. It is just rated for 5W charging. So you can not use any other faster wireless charger too.
However, it has reverse wireless charging, which supports charging using smartphones also. That is another satisfying feature to compensate for slow charging. You can use Standard Qi wireless chargers for any other alternate purposes.

We cant suggest to replace Apple Watch with an Android one at the same price. But if you have an Android phone, especially a smartphone made by Samsung—and want an extension of it on your wrist, you will not find anything more stylish and powerful smartwatch than the Galaxy Watch 3.
