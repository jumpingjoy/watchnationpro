With the snug fit, the rich haptic feedback, silent smooth notification sounds, great watch faces, intuitive UIs, and fantastic color rendition, this watch has all that it takes to be the best out of Apple's stable yet.

Users will not feel about lugging around my iPhone 11 anymore. With the cellular connection, users are entirely free to move around without the phone and light usage with the watch itself.
