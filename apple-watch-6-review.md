            <p>Under ISO standard, water resistance rating of 50 meters is guaranteed. So you can take it not only for pool even for ocean swimming too. Please check Water Lock before getting into swimming to prevent your watch touch screen’s activation. If you have selected swim mode, it automatically activates Watch Lock.</p>

## Final Words:
The primary consideration to buy Apple Watch Series 6 is that despite having the new sensors, which makes you feel like a tick-box exercise, you cannot find a better smartwatch on the market. It is just that this time around, it offers many features you'll want, along with many that you aren't aware you'd wish to, plus lots that you'll never use.

With the snug fit, the rich haptic feedback, silent smooth notification sounds, great watch faces, intuitive UIs, and fantastic color rendition, this watch has all that it takes to be the best out of Apple's stable yet.

Users will not feel about lugging around my iPhone 11 anymore. With the cellular connection, users are entirely free to move around without the phone and light usage with the watch itself.

If you are serious about your work, health and need to monitor your loved one's for their safety and security, this will be the best smartwatch and worth every penny. You can also go for Apple Watch SE, which doesn't have a blood oxygen sensor, ECG sensor, and heart rate, which is available in the same size as that of the former.

If you feel that the cost is over the board, we have reviewed other <u><a href= "https://www.watchnationpro.com/">best smartwatches for women</a><u> which you can check out.
