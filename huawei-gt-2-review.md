Huawei has been releasing smartwatches to meet today's consumer's choice. Huawei released Huawei GT smartwatch earlier. In line with the GT series, Huawei has released Huawei GT 2. Huawei's previous watches had some complaints in terms of battery life, software, and also it was good in some other features. Even from these mixed experiences, we could see some positive expectations for Huawei GT 2.

Huawei has grown up as a competitor to many top brands such as Samsung and Apple in manufacturing electronic devices. After being successful in smartphone and laptop manufacturing, Huawei started to release smartwatches. Huawei keeps on releasing an upgraded version of previous watches. We expect that Huawei GT 2 also meets our expectations. Surprisingly it has come with a battery life of two weeks and amazing fitness tracking features. Let's look at its features in detail.

We will look at the most important and essential features checked before going to other feature details:

#### How is the price point of the Huawei GT 2?

Our rating: ★★★★★ | 😎

It is priced at $157, which is very fair when looking at fitness and sport features. The price of Huawei GT 2 is less than Huawei's previous release Huawei GT. We would say it is valuable for every penny you spend on this purchase. At the time of release, the 42mm variant is priced at $250 and the 46mm variant at $279. But The prices dropped down.

#### How is the screen clarity of the Huawei GT 2?

Our rating: ★★★★★ | 😎

The Huawei GT 2 is available in two sizes. They are 42mm and 46mm. The 46mm watch dial comes with 1.39inch or 1.4inch(approx) AMOLED color display along with a touchscreen. It has a resolution of 454 * 454pixels. This resolution is more than the Samsung Galaxy Watch 2. The 42mm watch display has a resolution of 390 * 390pixels with a 1.2inch AMOLED color display.  
The Huawei GT 2 comes with an ambient light sensor. So the auto-brightness feature saves the battery life and makes it cool to see details on the watch. The display is crisp and sharp. Even under sunlight, the display and information on it are very legible. The display turns off automatically after 20 minutes of non-usage. There is no Always-on mode. However, it is easy to wake up the screen and turn off the screen with simple hand gestures. While raising your hand or wrist, it switches on the screen, and while moving your hand or wrist down, it turns off the screen.

#### How is the overall build quality of the Huawei GT 2?

Our rating: ★★★★★ | 😎

The overall build quality is excellent.

**Material Quality:** Huawei GT 2 has a traditional round shape, but it looks so classy. The dial is made of stainless steel. It has two physical buttons on the right side. These buttons are easy to interact as it works smoothly and gives pleasant tactile experience. There is a speaker located between these buttons.
The heart rate sensor is located in the back of the watch dial. It also has a charging system in the back. It has an interchangeable 22mm leather strap. Both the 42mm and 46mm variants have different looks.

#### How comfortable is it to wear and use the Huawei GT 2?

Our rating: ★★★★★ | 😎

** Weight:** The 46mm variant weighs 41g, and the 42mm weighs 29g without the strap. So the 42mm is very light to wear. As it tracks fitness activities well, having a lightweight is another advantage. The 46mm variant also is not too heavy to wear. It is almost all other Samsung and Apple watches' Weight only.  

**Strap size customization:** The 22mm watch strap is interchangeable. So you can customize with any 22mm sized strap available in the market. The 46mm variant is available in different straps. Those straps are Orange Fluoroelastomer Strap, Titanium Grey Metal Strap, Black Fluoroelastomer Strap, Brown Leather Strap. In the same way, the 42mm variant also comes with various straps.  They are Rose Gold Milanese Strap, Khaki Leather Strap, Black Fluoroelastomer Strap, Cyan Fluoroelastomer Strap.  Huawei gives its customer a Fluorine rubber strap along with a metal and leather strap in the purchase box.

#### How stylish Huawei GT 2 look? Can the looks be customized??

Our rating: ★★★★★ | 😎

Both 46mm and 42mm looks completely different. The 42mm variant has a curved round design, which looks smarter. The 46mm variant has markings around watch numbers which make it sportier. So both looks are available in one model.  

Customizable watch face: It is sad to mention that the watch face is not customizable in Huawei GT 2. It has a set of the preloaded watch face. You can choose any one of these for your watch face.

{% include section-cta.html button_text=">> CLICK HERE FOR BEST PRICE <<" button_url="#" blank="true" %}

#### How is the hardware performance of the Huawei GT 2?

Our rating: ★★★★☆ | 🙂

Huawei GT 2 has used its chip called Kirin A1. Kirin A1 processor-powered Huawei GT 2 has intelligent power-saving technology. 2GB RAM and 4GB storage seem decent. Out of 4GB storage, 2.2GB is usable, which allows you to store your music playlist and ensures smooth performance.  

#### How is the mobile OS compatibility of the Huawei GT 2 watch?

Our rating: ★★★★☆ | 🙂

It can be used with both Android and iOS smartphones. You can use it with all the smartphones with Android OS 4.4 or later and iOS 9 or later.

#### How effectively is the connectivity of Huawei GT 2 work?

Our rating: ★★★☆☆ | 😐

Huawei GT 2 has Bluetooth only for connectivity. It comes with Bluetooth 5.1 BLE/ BR/ EDR. NFC (Near Field Communication) for contactless payments is only available in China. So it is a big disappointment.  It doesn't have an LTE version model, too, so you need to depend on phones for calls for cellular connectivity. It doesn't have a Wi-Fi option.

#### How is the battery life of Huawei GT 2 work?</b></a>

Our rating: ★★★★★ | 😎

Huawei GT 2 promised two weeks of battery life. Yes. It is proved too if you have minimal usage all over the day. Thanks for the long-lasting battery life by Huawei. If you use it moderately, it will last for ten days during the test. The 42mm variant ensures seven days of battery life. Huawei GT 2 comes with its proprietary 455mAh charger. You need to use this proprietary charger only. However, it gets fully charged in one and half an hour using a pin-based charging puck. But other competitors are providing wireless chargers. Huawei GT 2 doesn't support reverse charging also. So you have no other way apart from charging it by given proprietory pin-based charger puck. The magnetic point is located under the watch dial for charging. If you are a sports person and uses fitness tracking mostly using GPS, it drains accordingly and lasts for seven days around for such persons.

We can look at the smart features that are used very frequently daily in a smartwatch.

#### How does screen scrolling work in Huawei GT 2?

Our rating: ★★★★☆ | 🙂

The upper button on the right side of the watch dial serves for going back action for interfacing. However, to scroll, you need to use swiping on the touchscreen. There is no such functional or digital crown for scrolling as we have in Samsung and Apple watches. When you are scrolling in a hurry, it doesn't respond to a few taps or touches. But we couldn't find any issues while swiping at a moderate speed.

#### How does the clock function work in Huawei GT 2?

Our rating: ★★★★★ | 😎

Time/date: yes. Regular clock functionalities are working well.

Once you find it, you can stop the ringtone by unlocking the phone or touching the watch screen.

#### How good is audio calls/recording quality in Huawei GT 2?

Our rating: ★★★★★ | 😎

Huawei GT 2 has a speaker which is loud enough to take calls and listen to music. As Huawei GT 2 doesn't release an LTE version, The watch must be connected with a smartphone for taking calls. The microphone also delivers good performance to speak with the caller. You can also use a headset for the same purpose if you wish. The watch shows call records also, which is quite impressive, so you don't need to take your phone out for this purpose.  During the tests, we could not find any drop-outs while answering calls on the watch itself.
