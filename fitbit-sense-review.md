The overall build quality is equal to the best smartwatches in the market. The bezel around the display is bigger than previous Fitbit smartwatches. The physical button on the left side is replaced with the inductive button but below the watch face, which results in hurting your skin while pressing over it. This inductive button acts as a home button.
