## What Precautions Women Must Take When Having Safety Issues?

### Tips to Reduce Dangers in Falling
Whether you have a drop sensor or not, you'll find things you can do in order to stop falling in and outside of the home.

#### Ways to prevent drops in your home

* Safe rugs with nonslip carpet pads.
* Install grab bars in showers and bathtubs.
* Affix nonslip stickers to slippery surfaces.
* Insert motion-activated night lighting to halls and stairways.
* Maintain traffic paths without any clutter.
* Ensure handrails are safe.
* Wear shoes, slipper, or socks with nonslip grips at the floor.
* Keep on landscaping as well as other external care such as fallen leaves and snow removal.

#### Ways to prevent falls Outside Your Home
* Wear sturdy shoes with good grip that match nicely.
* Take your own time. You are more likely to trip or stumble if you are in a rush.
* Be conscious of your environment. Avoid walking and speaking on the telephone at precisely the exact same time, and be aware of cracks in sidewalks and other irregular surfaces.
* Take good care of curbs. Stop for a second and be certain you've got a fantastic feeling of a suppress's height before stepping down or up.
* Use handrails, a cane, or other mobility service to maintain your motion stable and steady.
* Leave your porch light to be certain that you get into the door securely once you get home.
