Hey guys, I’m Sarah! Ever since I was a kid, ​my dad introduced me to playing sports such as tennis, badminton, and baseball. Since that time, I learned that being physically active is very crucial in maintaining a healthy body.

I thought that everything was going well until I entered work, where I suffered menstruation cycle, which negatively affected my going to the office. I was also gaining weight and which affected my overall health. I wanted to stay at home because I don’t want to see other people looking at my body. Those were the hard days.

​After going back and forth to health and fitness consultants and, based on their suggestion trying out smartwatches and the weight loss programs, I finally saw noticeable improvements in my overall health conditions.

​I can look at myself now in the mirror without feeling bad about myself. ​I can confidently talk in front of a lot of people without worrying about what they will think about my looks. And because using smartwatches saved me from my health problem, I’m 100% dedicated to helping you guys achieve the healthy body you’ve always wanted.As an Amazon Associate I earn from qualifying purchases.
