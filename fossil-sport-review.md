### Fossil Sport Review: Quick and Important Factors Checked

{% include image.html img="smartwatch-quick-feature-check.webp" alt="Alt for image" caption="smartwatch-quick-feature-check" align="center" %}

We will look at the most important and essential features checked before going to other feature details:

#### How is the price point of the Fossil Sport?

Our rating: ★★★★☆ | 🙂

According to different regions, it varies from $149 to $275. It is available for $149 on the Fossil website. Both the variants 41mm and 43mm watches are available for the same price, which is good to know, unlike other company watches. If you are looking for budget watches and want fitness features too, Fossil sport ticks your checklist. It has done some justice as per its price level. As per the price only, you can expect the features and its performance.

#### How is the screen clarity of the Fossil Sport?

Our rating: ★★★★★ | 😎

Fossil Sport comes with 1.2inch (approx) or 1.19inch OLED display.
It is bright and sharp. Texts and everything is legible even in the bright sunlight.  The ambient light sensor adjusts the brightness of the watch according to the ambiance’s light. The touch screen display easies the user interface.
Unlike other watches, notifications are listed while swiping up from down. And swiping down from up takes you to quick toggles. Swiping right shows Google assistant. You can swipe left to view tiles.
Touch responses are quick.

#### How is the overall build quality of the Fossil Sport?

Our rating: ★★★★★ | 😎

We would say the overall build quality is excellent.

Fossil sport has similar to classic watches in terms of shapes. Yes. It has a round dial and three buttons on the right edge. The middle one is the functional crown. Pressing the functional crown takes to all apps list. And this crown works for moving or scrolling amid menus, information, and adjusting volume.  The remaining two buttons can be customized for any other apps as per your choice.
The upper part of the watch case is made of aluminum, and the lower part is of nylon plastic. These lower part edges look somewhat crude. Fossil sport has released two variants. It released 41mm and 43mm sizable watches. A 43mm watch case is ideal for both men and women. 41mm watch suits women's wrist perfectly. It is available in many colors, which is a notable one. You can choose from a wide range of colors. The 22mm silicone strap is easily removable and easy to clean.
For charging purposes, a magnetic ring on the watch case's backside is helpful for wireless charging.
It looks good while seeing from far away. But it looks like a toy on the wrist in some colors. But it is up to people’s choice. Many find it different fashion too.

##### Water Resistance:
Water-resistant of the Fossil Sport is measured 5ATM or up to 50m. Most excitingly, the Hand Wash feature attracts more attention. It starts a timer for the 20s when it detects hand washing. Water-resistance is the highlight of WatchOS 7.

#### How comfortable is it to wear and use the Fossil Sport?

Our rating: ★★★★★ | 😎

** Weight:** Because of its low weight compared with other watches, it is very comfortable to wear. It is light and stylish too to wear. It weighs around 36-40g which is lightweight to wear, mostly for a sportsperson. Sportsperson finds it very comfortable to wear while workouts, running, etc.

#### How stylish Fossil Sport looks? Can the looks be customized??

As it is available in multiple colors, it attracts many people having different tastes. Straps are removable. So you can find any other straps for your watch too.

#### How is the hardware performance of the Fossil Sport?

Our rating: ★★★★★ | 😎

The new feature of Fossil sport is Snapdragon wear 3100, which is an upgrade of snapdragon wear 2100, which was the only option to manufacturers before. However, we couldn’t find much difference between these two. Qualcomm’s Snapdragon wears 3100 also uses the same CPU, GPU, and the same 28nm process has been used to build. So if you look at Snapdragon's changes wear 3100, it has improved motion tracking and battery life. But the improvement in battery life is not witnessed practically.  The new-ultra-low-power co-processor works for ambient sensing, which results in better battery life theoretically.

#### How is the mobile OS compatibility of the Apple watch?

Our rating: ★★★☆☆ | 😐

It is compatible with both Android and iOS phones. But the Wear OS app is needed to use. But it is not compatible with Android Go editions. However, while using iOS or iPhones, features are very limited when comparing with Android phones. You need to depend on third-party apps and watch apps for many features while pairing with iPhones.

#### How effectively is the connectivity of Fossil Sport work?

Our rating: ★★★★★ | 😎

Available connectivity options are Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, and NFC. It is empowered with Wi-Fi 802.11 b/g/n, Bluetooth 4.2 Low energy.  

#### How is the battery life of Fossil Sport work?</b></a>

Our rating: ★★★★★ | 😎

It is a bit disappointing to have around 25 hours of battery life only from a full-charge. You need to charge it every day.

Always-on display enabled: The battery life lasts for less than a day if the Always-on display has been enabled.

Always-on display disabled: When the always-on display is not enabled, the battery life lasts for one day or around 25 hours.

## Final Words:
The Fossil Sport is one of the best Wear OS watches available, with its improved processor, lengthier battery life and stylish, lightweight design. But Wear OS has not evolved much when it comes to fitness features, when compared to Apple's watchOS or Fitbit’s OS, which can provide much deeper analysis of your workouts.

Among the best cheap alternative smartwatches, you can go for  the Apple Watch Series 3 or the Samsung Galaxy Watch Active, but the cost of both are $100 more than the Fossil Sport. Fossil Sport comes at $99, which is a bargain — and has a fashionable look.
