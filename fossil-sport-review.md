We would say the overall build quality is excellent.

#### How is the hardware performance of the Fossil Sport?

Our rating: ★★★★★ | 😎

The new feature of Fossil sport is Snapdragon wear 3100, which is an upgrade of snapdragon wear 2100, which was the only option to manufacturers before.

So if you look at Snapdragon's changes wear 3100, it has improved motion tracking and battery life. But the improvement in battery life is not witnessed practically.  The new-ultra-low-power co-processor works for ambient sensing, which results in better battery life theoretically.
