It is bright and sharp. Texts and everything is legible even in the bright sunlight.  The ambient light sensor adjusts the brightness of the watch according to the ambience’s light. The touch screen display easies the user interface.

Our rating: ★★★★★ | 😎

We would say the overall build quality is excellent.

Pressing the functional crown takes to all apps list. And this crown works for moving or scrolling amid menus, information and adjusting volume.  The remaining two buttons can be customized for any other apps as per user’s choice.
The upper part of watch case is made of aluminum and the lower part is of nylon plastic. This lower part edges looks somewhat crude. Fossil sport has released two variants. It released 41mm and 43mm sizable watches. Obviously 43mm watch case is ideal for both men and women. 41mm watch suits women wrist perfectly. It is available in many colors which is notable one. You can choose from a wide range of colors. The 22mm silicone strap is easily removable and easy to clean.
For charging purpose, a magnetic ring on the back side of watch case is helpful for wireless charging.
It looks good while seeing from far away. But it looks like a toy on the wrist in some colors. But it is up to people’s choice. Many find it different fashion too.

**Water Resistance:** Water-resistant of the Fossil Sport is measured 5ATM or up to 50m. Most excitingly, the Hand Wash feature attracts more attention. It starts a timer for the 20s when it detects hand washing. Water-resistance is the highlight of WatchOS 7.

#### How is the hardware performance of the Fossil Sport?

Our rating: ★★★★★ | 😎

The new feature of Fossil sport is Snapdragon wear 3100 which is a upgrade of snapdragon wear 2100 which was the only option to manufacturers before. However, we couldn’t find much difference between these two. Qualcomm’s Snapdragon wear 3100 also uses the same CPU, GPU and the same 28nm process has been used to build. So if you look at the changes given by Snapdragon wear 3100, it has improved motion tracking and battery life. But improvement in battery life is not witnessed practically.  The new-ultra-low-power co-processor works for ambient sensing which results in better battery life theoretically.

#### How is the mobile OS compatibility of the Apple watch?

Our rating: ★★★☆☆ | 😐

It is compatible with both Android and iOS phones. But Wear OS app is needed to use. But it is not compatible with Android Go editions.
