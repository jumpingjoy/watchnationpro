### Sarah Hollen (Owner)

​Hey guys, I’m Sarah! Ever since I was a child, ​my dad introduced me to playing sports such as tennis, badminton, and baseball. Since then, I learned that being physically active is essential in maintaining a healthy body.

I thought everything was going well until I entered work, where I suffered menstruation cycle which negatively affected my going to office. I was also gaining weight and which affected my overall health. I chose to stay at home because I don’t want to see other people looking at my body. Those were the hard days.

​After going back and forth to health and fitness consultants and based on their suggestion trying out smartwatches along with the weight loss programs, finally I saw noticeable improvements on my overall health conditions.

​As of writing, I can look at myself in the mirror without feeling bad about myself. ​I can confidently talk in front of a lot of people without worrying about what they’ll think about my looks. And because using smartwatches saved me from my health problem, I’m 100% dedicated in helping you guys achieve the healthy body you’ve always wanted.

​Hi, my name is Rwanda! Same with Sarah, I also experienced a severe problems on delayed menstruation and obesity when I was in my early 20’s. At first, I thought it was just normal. You know women and hormones don’t work well sometimes, right? But when I started to realize the dangers of delayed menstruation and its relationship with lack of menstrual hygiene, that’s when I knew that something’s has to done immediately.

What’s more irritating there is a repetition of this everymonth. It’s like a never-ending cycle. I’m sure some of you women have experienced the same many times in their life.

When I tried using smartphones to track my menstrual cycle, it didn’t​ help me track it properly and found the tracking to be successful when I used smartwatches. So as a Content ​Editor at WatchNationpro.com, I’m here to help you guys discover the advantages of smartwatches so we can all keep a healthy body.

### Tracey Track (Content Manager)

​What’s up? I’m Tracey. I’ve been in the health and fitness industry as a ​Fitness ​Coach for 7 years now. I’ve known people who passionately work out to build their gym bodies and most of them forget ​one important thing — to take care of their health.

​When we workout, we sweat a lot and if it sits on our skin for a long time, it can block our sweat pores. ​Hence, monitoring your sweat is also essential.

Now, my mission is not just to help people achieve their body goals but to also guide them on how to have overall fitness using smartwatches, or at least maintain it.

As a writer at WatchNationPro, join me and the team in making this mission come true.
