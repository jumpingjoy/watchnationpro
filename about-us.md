### Sarah Hollen (Owner)

​Hey guys, I'm Sarah! Ever since I was a kid, ​my dad introduced me to playing sports such as tennis, badminton, and baseball. Since that time, I learned that being physically active is very crucial in maintaining a healthy body.

I thought that everything was going well until I entered work, where I suffered menstruation cycle, which negatively affected my going to the office. I was also gaining weight and which affected my overall health. I wanted to stay at home because I don't want to see other people looking at my body. Those were the hard days.

​After going back and forth to health and fitness consultants and, based on their suggestion trying out smartwatches and the weight loss programs, I finally saw noticeable improvements in my overall health conditions.

​I can look at myself now in the mirror without feeling bad about myself. ​I can confidently talk in front of a lot of people without worrying about what they will think about my looks. And because using smartwatches saved me from my health problem, I'm 100% dedicated to helping you guys achieve the healthy body you've always wanted.As an Amazon Associate I earn from qualifying purchases.

### Rwanda Bryan (Marketing Manager)

​Hi, my name is Rwanda! Same with Sarah, I also experienced severe problems with delayed menstruation and obesity when I was in my early 20's. At first, I thought it was an average phenomenon. You know ladies' hormones do not work well sometimes, right? But when I started to realize the dangers of delayed menstruation and its relationship with lack of menstrual hygiene, that's when I knew that something has to be done immediately.

What's more irritating, there is a repetition of this every month. It's like a never-ending cycle. I'm sure some of you women have experienced the same many times in their life.

When I tried using smartphones to track my menstrual cycle, it didn't​ help me track it properly, and I found the tracking to be successful when I used smartwatches. So as a Content ​Editor at WatchNationpro.com, I'm here to help you guys discover the advantages of smartwatches so we can all keep a healthy body.

### Tracey Track (Content Manager)
{% include image.html img="tracey-track.webp" alt="Tracey-Track" caption="Tracey Track" align="left" %}
​What's up? I'm Tracey. I've been in the fitness industry as a ​Fitness ​Coach for seven years now. I have known people who passionately work out to build their bodies, and most of them tend to forget ​one important thing — to take good care of their health.

​When we do a workout, we sweat a lot, and if it is affecting our skin for a long time, it can tend to block our sweat pores. ​Hence, monitoring your sweat is also essential, which can be performed through a smartwatch.

Now, my mission is not just to help people achieve their body goals but also to guide them on how to have overall fitness using smartwatches, or at least maintain it.

As a writer at WatchNationPro, join the team and me in making this mission come true.
