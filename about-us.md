​Hey guys, I’m Casey! Ever since I was a child, ​my dad introduced me to playing sports such as basketball, football, and baseball. Since then, I learned that being physically active is essential in maintaining a healthy body.

I thought everything was going well until I entered college, where I suffered severe acne which negatively affected my self-esteem. Instead of having the confidence to build new friendships (or even asking my crush out on a date), I chose to stay at home because I don’t want to see other people looking at my face. Those were the hard days.

​After going back and forth to ​dermatologists and trying out tons of anti-acne products, none of it worked and I was about to give up. It was until a friend of mine introduced me to vitamin C serum ​and I saw noticeable improvements on my skin.

​As of writing, I can look at myself in the mirror without feeling bad about myself. ​I can confidently talk in front of a lot of people without worrying about what they’ll think about my looks. And because vitamin c serum saved me from my skin problem, I’m 100% dedicated in helping you guys achieve the healthy skin you’ve always wanted.

​Hi, my name is Kayla! Same with Casey, I also experienced a severe acne breakout when I was in my early 20’s. At first, I thought it was just normal. You know women and hormones don’t work well sometimes, right? But when I started to get cystic acne all over my face, that’s when I knew that something’s not right with my skin.

What’s more irritating there is when a zit clears out, another one pops up. It’s like a never-ending cycle. I’m sure some of you guys experienced the same once in their life.

All the products I tried didn’t​help me clear my acne and the marks it left on my face except for one. And that is vitamin C serum. So as a Content ​Editor at Skin Starts With C, I’m here to help you guys discover the wonders of this product so we can all keep a healthy skin.

​What’s up? I’m Carl. I’ve been in the health and fitness industry as a ​Fitness ​Coach for 7 years now. I’ve known people who passionately work out to build their gym bodies and most of them forget ​one important thing — to take care of their skin.

​When we workout, we sweat a lot and if it sits on our skin for a long time, it can block our sweat pores. ​If bacteria is present, it may lead to acne and other skin conditions like skin rash. I know this because some of my clients have this dilemma.

Now, my mission is not just to help people achieve their body goals but to also guide them on how to have healthy skin, or at least maintain it.

As a writer at Skin Starts with C, join me and the team in making this mission come true.
