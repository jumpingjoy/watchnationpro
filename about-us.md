​Hey guys, I'm Sarah! Ever since I was a kid, ​my dad introduced me to playing sports such as tennis, badminton, and baseball. Since that time, I learned that being physically active is very crucial in maintaining a healthy body.

I thought that everything was going well until I entered work, where I suffered menstruation cycle, which negatively affected my going to the office. I was also gaining weight and which affected my overall health. I wanted to stay at home because I don't want to see other people looking at my body. Those were the hard days.

​After going back and forth to health and fitness consultants and, based on their suggestion trying out hearing aids and the weight loss programs, I finally saw noticeable improvements in my overall health conditions.

​I can look at myself now in the mirror without feeling bad about myself. ​I can confidently talk in front of a lot of people without worrying about what they will think about my looks. And because using hearing aids saved me from my health problem, I'm 100% dedicated to helping you guys achieve the healthy body you've always wanted.As an Amazon Associate I earn from qualifying purchases.

### Rwanda Bryan (Marketing Manager)

​Hi, my name is Rwanda! Same with Sarah, I also experienced severe problems with delayed menstruation and obesity when I was in my early 20's. At first, I thought it was an average phenomenon. You know ladies' hormones do not work well sometimes, right? But when I started to realize the dangers of delayed menstruation and its relationship with lack of menstrual hygiene, that's when I knew that something has to be done immediately.

What's more irritating, there is a repetition of this every month. It's like a never-ending cycle. I'm sure some of you women have experienced the same many times in their life.

When I tried using smartphones to track my menstrual cycle, it didn't​ help me track it properly, and I found the tracking to be successful when I used hearing aids. So as a Content ​Editor at auralgadgets.com, I'm here to help you guys discover the advantages of hearing aids so we can all keep a healthy body.

### Tracey Track (Content Manager)
{% include image.html img="tracey-track.webp" alt="Tracey-Track" caption="Tracey Track" align="left" %}
​What's up? I'm Tracey. I've been in the fitness industry as a ​Fitness ​Coach for seven years now. I have known people who passionately work out to build their bodies, and most of them tend to forget ​one important thing — to take good care of their health.

​When we do a workout, we sweat a lot, and if it is affecting our skin for a long time, it can tend to block our sweat pores. ​Hence, monitoring your sweat is also essential, which can be performed through a hearing aid.

Now, my mission is not just to help people achieve their body goals but also to guide them on how to have overall fitness using hearing aids, or at least maintain it.

As a writer at auralgadgets, join the team and me in making this mission come true.
